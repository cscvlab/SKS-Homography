There are four types of files uploaded.

1. 4-point case files:
CompKernelFrom4.m: the first way to compute kernel transformation.
CompKernelFrom4_2.m: the second way to compute kernel transformation.
ComputeHomo4.m: the complete function to compute homography which call the above two kernel functions.
veri_4Pts.m: a script to verify the correctness of homographies computed by two different ways. 


2. n-point case files:
CompKernelFromN.m: the linear method to compute kernel transformation.
ComputeHomoN.m: the complete function to compute homography which firstly call 'CompKernelFromN' as a linear solution, followed by a 1-step Gauss-Newton optimization. TAP are selected by ordered sampling.
veri_NPts.m: a script to verify the correctness of homographies computed by the linear method and the optimization. 

3. Simulation experiments files:
ComputeHomo_DLT.m: function of NDLT implemention that follows "Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision".
simu_noise_chessboard.m: 1st simu experiment where grid points are used to estimate homography under different noises.
simu_pose_chessboard.m: 2nd simu experiment where grid points are used to estimate homography under different poses.
simu_numberPts_random.m: 3-1 simu experiment where random points with different numbers are used to estimate homography.
simu_numberPts_100.m: 3-2 simu experiment where 100 random points are used to estimate homography under different sampling ways of TAP.
ComputeHomoN_2.m: revise the ordered sampling of TAP to random sampling for comparison in 3-2 simu experiment.

4. Draw real experiment file:
ZUBUDreprojERROR5.txt: statistics results of ZubuD Dataset. 
draw_real_results.m: a script to draw the figures shown in real experiments.
