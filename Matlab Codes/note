There are three types of .m files uploaded.

1. 4-point case files:
CompKernelFrom4.m: the first way to compute kernel transformation.
CompKernelFrom4_2.m: the second way to compute kernel transformation.
ComputeHomo4.m: the complete function to compute homography which call the above two kernel functions.

2. n-point case files:
CompKernelFromN.m: the linear method to compute kernel transformation.
ComputeHomoN.m: the complete function to compute homography which firstly call 'CompKernelFromN' as a linear solution, followed by a 1-step Gauss-Newton optimization. TAP are selected by ordered sampling.

3. test file:
test_randomPattern.m: test SKS-I, SKS-II and SKS-n with coplanar random points.
